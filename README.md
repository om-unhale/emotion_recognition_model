# emotion_recognition_model
This script fine-tunes ResNet50 for emotion recognition using the FER2013 dataset. Images are preprocessed with scaling and augmentation, and the pretrained ResNet50 model is extended with custom layers. Initial training freezes base layers, followed by fine-tuning with selective unfreezing.  metrics plotted for evaluation.
