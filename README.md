# emotion_recognition_model
This script fine-tunes the ResNet50 model for emotion recognition using the FER2013 dataset. It preprocesses the data by scaling pixel values and augmenting the training set with transformations like rotation, shifts, and flips to improve generalization. The ResNet50 model, pretrained on ImageNet, is used as the base, with its layers initially frozen to retain previously learned features. Custom layers are added for emotion recognition, and the model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and accuracy metrics. Fine-tuning is performed by unfreezing the top layers of the base model and training them with a reduced learning rate for better performance. Metrics such as loss and accuracy across epochs can be visualized using matplotlib to assess performance trends during training and fine-tuning.
